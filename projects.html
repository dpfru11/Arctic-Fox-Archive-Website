    <p>This was my first Python project. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the code since it is stored on a virtual server from my High School. I can't embed the actual project, but I have pictures of the code. It's not beatable, but at the time it was a more complicated project I made with a partner where I ended up doing all of the work. It's hilarious how trivial a lot of the problems with this code are to me now, and I'd like to take a crack at redoing this some day. </p>
